# Unify Picture Names
This program will help you to save and present pictures from different camera vendors in a chronological order by unifying their names.

## Downloads:

## Function:
The program will go through all pictures in the specified input folder, including subfolders.<br>
Only .jpg, .jpeg and .png files will be processed, while all others will be copied without any change.<br>
Next, the program will try to get the capture date from the image exif data.<br>
Every image containing this information will then be renamed according to the following pattern: YYYYMMDD_hhmmss<br>
The renamed images will be saved into the specified output folder.

This will allow you to save or present pictures from different camera vendors in a chronological order.

Iâ€™ve already tested it successfully with LG and Samsung (Android Phone), Apple (iPhone), a Sony Camera, Android WhatsApp and GoPro images.

I'm frequently using this program in combination with another one helping you to automatically rotate your images into horizontal orientation.<br>
